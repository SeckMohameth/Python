# declaring a variable

greeting = "Hello" # string
age = 25 # int
temp = 78.88 # float
loggedIn = True # boolean
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "grapes", "banana"] # list 



name = "Mohameth" # This is a string becuase it's wrapped in quotes

jobTitle = "Software Engineer" # another variable assigned a string value

# concatinating strings in the print function
print("My name is " + name + "and I am a " + jobTitle)


# You don't have to declare a variable with let or const like in JavaScript

# JavaScript
# let name = "Mohameth";
 
 # and don't have to declare the data type before either like in C

 # C
 # int age = 25;
